Using the data collected between 2021 and 2024 from “Enquête Loyers et Charges” (Rents and Charges Survey) of the French Polynesian Statistics Institute, this paper develops a hedonic price model of private rents. The response variable of this model is the rent, including charges, of private dwelling on the islands of Tahiti and Moorea. So as to choose the best explanatory variables 270 models were calculated and compared using their Bayesian and Akaike Information Criterion. The performance of the developped model are presented in Annexe [Performance du modèle].  

This project was completed as part of a Bachelor's level ( Licence 3 ) internship at the French Polynesian Statistics Institute. It resulted in the creation of a report written in French. The report was prepared using Quarto and can be accessed at: https://teiki-h.github.io/hedonic-price-private-rent.html.  
This repository serves as a public version of a private ISPF repository, which I was authorized to duplicate.
